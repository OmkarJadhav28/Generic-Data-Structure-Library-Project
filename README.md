# Generic-Data-Structure-Library-Project

> This project is developed using C++ programming.
> This project contains all the implementation of the functions from all the data structures.
> As this library contains which are implemented in generic manner. I can use that function with any type of data type.
> This library is helpful for the application programmer who needs the implementation of data structure in its application or project.
> In this project I provide the implementation of Singly linear linkedlist, Singly Circular linkedlist, Doubly Linear linkedlist, Doubly Circular linkedlist, Stack, Queue, binary search tree, etc..
> for all these data structure, I also provide some customize fuctionalities which are not available in any inbuilt library.
